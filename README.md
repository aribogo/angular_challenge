# Angular_challenge
### Introduction
This is an activity to apply the acquired  knowledge from Angular classes. 

### What was proposed
To develop a shopping app.

### How to execute the application?

    1. Clone the project in your terminal;
    2. Execute the JAVA project in your Java IDE;
    3. Execute the Angular project in Visual Studio Code;
    4. Access http://localhost:4200/.

#### How to Authenticate
When starting the application, the user has to log in to be able to access the functionalities:

- User:

    > username/email: exemplo@exemplo.com

    > password: Gft2021

**You can create new users to access the Consumer application**

#### Database population
The database is seeded automatically when user starts the application.

##### What is automatically in the database?
- 1 customer;
- 5 products;
- 1 sale;

##### Tips
- When creating a new user in the app **the new password will be displayed in the console**;
- The images are saved in the project root. If you want to change the path, go to application.properties;

### Requirements

- Java
- IDE or Terminal for both applications
- API plataform
- Angular

- JPA: "...Improve the implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the amount that's actually needed";
- H2: SQL embedded database.
- Spring Security: "...customizable authentication and access-control framework.";
- Flyway: "Flyway is an open-source database-migration tool";
